### Key Points

- **Modularity**: Each module encapsulates its logic, allowing for better organization.
- **Type Safety**: Generics provide type-safe operations, enhancing robustness.
- **Concurrency**: Asynchronous and parallel constructs enable efficient processing without blocking execution.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for error checking improve reliability.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Allows for efficient use of resources, adapting to the needs of the application.
