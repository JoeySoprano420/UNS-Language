        tag = tag_name;
    }
    
    void connect(Node other) {
        connections.push_back(other);
    }

    void render() {
        // Render logic for the node
        printf("<div class='node'>%s</div>", tag);
        // Logic to visualize connections
    }
}

// Main HTML rendering
void renderInterface() {
    Node node1("Input Data");
    Node node2("Process Data");
    
    // Example of connecting nodes
    node1.connect(node2);
    
    // Render nodes
    node1.render();
    node2.render();
}

// Entry point
int main() {

// JavaScript for frontend interaction
function executeNodes() {
    const inputData = gatherInputData(); // Function to gather input data from UI

    fetch('http://your-backend-url/execute', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ data: inputData })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(result => {
        // Handle the result and update UI
        updateUIWithResults(result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error executing nodes:', error);
    });
}
```

### 4. **Deployment and Testing**
