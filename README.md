- **Variables**: Each variable must be declared before use. The declaration is done via the `:=` operator. A variable can hold values of basic types (number, string, boolean).
- **Scope**: Variables defined within a module or block are scoped to that module or block. Nested blocks can access variables defined in outer blocks but cannot modify them unless explicitly passed.

#### 2. **Control Flow**
- **If Statements**: The semantics for `if` statements involve evaluating the condition expression. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the statements in the `then` branch execute; otherwise, the `else` branch executes, if present.
- **While Loops**: For `while` loops, the condition is evaluated before each iteration. If `true`, the loop body executes; if `false`, the loop terminates.

#### 3. **Function Calls**
- **Node Invocation**: Calling a node with `call` requires providing the correct number of parameters. The parameters are passed by value, and the node's output can be assigned to a variable or used directly.
- **Return Values**: Nodes return values that can be captured through assignment or utilized within expressions.

#### 4. **Modules**
- **Namespace Isolation**: Each module has its own namespace, preventing naming collisions between variables and nodes in different modules.
- **Import/Export**: A module can `export` its nodes and variables, allowing other modules to `import` them. Imported items can be used without fully qualifying their names, provided they are accessible.

#### 5. **Generics**
- **Type Parameters**: When declaring a generic node, the types specified in the type parameter list can be used within the node's input and output. This enforces type safety, allowing operations to be performed on collections of different types without sacrificing performance or reliability.
- **Type Inference**: The compiler can infer the type parameters based on the arguments passed to a generic node.

#### 6. **Concurrency**
- **Async Execution**: The `async` statement allows a block of code to run asynchronously. The execution of statements within this block does not block the main thread.
- **Awaiting Results**: The `await` statement can be used to pause execution until a promise is resolved, enabling a smooth asynchronous flow.
- **Parallel Execution**: Statements within a `parallel` block can be executed concurrently, leveraging multi-core processors.

#### 7. **Error Handling**
- **Error Scanning**: The `scan` statement checks nodes for errors. If an error is found, it categorizes it based on the defined error type and triggers an explanation and healing process.
- **Graceful Recovery**: The healing process may involve corrective actions or logging errors for debugging purposes.

#### 8. **Data Handling**
- **Transformations**: The `transform` statement processes data based on conditions. It may involve cleaning up residuals or modifying data structures.
- **Exporting Data**: The `export` statement allows data to be sent out in specified formats, including any necessary metadata.

### Example of Execution Flow

#### Example Code Snippet
```plaintext
module $Calculator {
    node $CalculateSum<T>* {
        input: $a, $b*
        output: $sum*
        process: $sum = $a + $b*
    }
}

async {
    call $Calculator.$CalculateSum<int>* { parameters: $10, $20* }
    response {
        action: $DisplayResult*
    }
}
```

### Execution Semantics
1. **Module Declaration**: The `Calculator` module is defined and will isolate its variables and nodes.
2. **Async Execution**: The block runs asynchronously, allowing other operations to continue without waiting for the `CalculateSum` node to complete.
3. **Function Call**: The `$CalculateSum` node is invoked with integers `10` and `20`.
4. **Return Value**: The result is captured and sent to `$DisplayResult` for further handling.

### Considerations for Implementing Semantics

- **Type Checking**: Implement checks during the compilation phase to ensure types match across assignments, function calls, and returns.
- **Memory Management**: Determine how memory is allocated for variables and how garbage collection or reference counting is handled for dynamic memory.
- **Concurrency Model**: Define how the runtime will handle multi-threading and potential race conditions when executing concurrent code.

### Summary

The semantics defined above provide a robust framework for the Universal NodeScript language, detailing how each component behaves and interacts during execution. By adhering to these semantic rules, the language can offer a clear and predictable environment for developers to create applications, ensuring type safety, modularity, and efficient execution.

### Function Call Semantics (Continued)
- Calling a node involves specifying the node's name and providing the required parameters within parentheses.
- The parameters passed must correspond to the expected types defined in the node's generic declaration if applicable.
- The response from the node call can be used in subsequent expressions or assignments.

### Concurrency Semantics
- The `async` statement allows multiple statements to execute concurrently without blocking the main thread.
- The `await` statement pauses the execution of the current block until the awaited expression resolves, allowing asynchronous operations to complete.
- The `parallel` statement allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple statements, enhancing performance by leveraging concurrent processing.

### Error Handling Semantics
- The `scan` statement is used to check for errors during node execution.
- The `error_block` defines conditions that trigger error handling, including the type of error, explanations, and healing processes to recover from the error.
- This promotes robustness and stability within the application by ensuring that errors are handled gracefully.

### Node and Module Interactions
- Nodes can be exported from a module using the `export` statement, making them available for use in other modules.
- Imports are handled via the `import` statement, allowing modules to access functionality defined elsewhere.
- This modular approach fosters code reuse and organization, enabling larger applications to be built efficiently.

### Code Example
Here's an example demonstrating the use of some of the constructs defined in the grammar:

```plaintext
module MathUtils {
    generic node Add<T, U> * {
        input_output_block {
            connect: $Input1, $Input2
        }
        response {
            call $Result * { 
                parameter_list: $Input1 + $Input2 
            }
        }
    }
}

module Main {
    import MathUtils;

    async {
        let x := 5;
        let y := 10;

        call Add<Number, Number> * { 
            parameter_list: x, y 
        } response {
            link "$Result" { connect: $Sum }
        }
    }

    checkpoint $CurrentState at $NodeName*;
    scan $NodeName* for errors* {
        if error_found {
            error_type: "Computation Error";
            error_explanation: "Failed to compute sum.";
            healing_process: "Retry the operation.";
        }
    }
}
```

### Summary
The Universal NodeScript language, with its grammar and semantics, provides a powerful framework for building modular and concurrent applications. By leveraging concepts like generics, error handling, and concurrency constructs, developers can create flexible, reusable, and robust code structures that enhance productivity and maintainability. This language aims to address the needs of modern software development, promoting clean syntax and clear semantics for effective programming.
